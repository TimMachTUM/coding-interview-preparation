# Coding Interview Preparation Materials

Welcome to my collection of Jupyter notebooks, a compilation of coding exercises and solutions aimed at preparing for coding interviews. This repository contains problems sourced from platforms like HackerRank and LeetCode, organized by topics relevant to software engineering interviews. Each notebook represents my personal approach to solving these problems, which may not always be the optimal solution. For alternative solutions and more insights, I recommend checking out the discussions and user solutions on the respective problem pages on HackerRank and LeetCode.

### Introduction

This repository is designed to help anyone looking to strengthen their problem-solving and coding skills in preparation for software engineering interviews. The exercises are categorized by topic, making it easy to focus on specific areas of interest or weakness.
I highly recommend checking out the original questions on leetcode and using the limited IDE in leetcode or HackerRank to practice as during coding interviews you might also have limited resources.

### Arrays

This section contains problems related to array data structures, including but not limited to traversing, manipulation, searching, and sorting.

### Binary Search

Problems that involve the binary search algorithm, including variations and applications in different scenarios.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

DFS-related exercises, showcasing different ways to apply this algorithm in tree and graph traversal problems.

### Dynamic Programming

A collection of dynamic programming problems, demonstrating the use of memoization and tabulation to solve complex recursive problems.

### Graph Theory

Exercises that cover various aspects of graph theory, including traversal, shortest paths, and graph-based algorithms.

### Linked List

Problems focusing on linked list data structures, encompassing single and doubly linked lists, circular lists, and related operations.

### Trees

Tree-related exercises, including binary trees, binary search trees, tree traversals, and tree-based algorithms.

### Stacks

This section deals with stack data structure problems, showcasing their application in algorithmic solutions.

### Others

A miscellaneous collection of problems that don't neatly fit into the above categories but are relevant to coding interviews.

### Additional Material

To supplement your preparation, here are some recommended reading materials:

- **"Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell**: A comprehensive guide covering the most important interview questions and strategies for software engineers.
- [**system-design-primer**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer): Offers material for system design interviews with questions and sample solutions.
- **Online Platforms**: Engaging with communities on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), and other coding practice websites can provide invaluable insights and additional problems to solve.
- [**neetcode.io**](https://neetcode.io/roadmap): provides an overview for the most important coding questions in interviews and a roadmap. Especially useful if you don't know where or how to start.
