    "### Graph Basics\n",
    "- **Definition**: A graph is a collection of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges. \n",
    "- **Types**: \n",
    "  - **Undirected Graph**: Edges have no direction.\n",
    "  - **Directed Graph (Digraph)**: Edges have a direction.\n",
    "  - **Weighted Graph**: Each edge has a weight or cost associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Graph Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Finds the shortest path on unweighted graphs.\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Explores the graph level by level starting from a given node.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Shortest path, level order traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Depth-First Search (DFS)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Uses a stack (often implicitly through recursion) to explore the graph.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Path finding, topological sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dijkstra's Algorithm\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Finds the shortest path on weighted graphs without negative weights.\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Uses a priority queue to greedily select the next closest vertex to the source.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: GPS navigation, network routing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bellman-Ford Algorithm\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Finds the shortest path on weighted graphs, handling negative weights.\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Relaxes edges repeatedly to find the shortest path.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Currency arbitrage, distributed systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Floyd-Warshall Algorithm\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Dynamic programming approach to compute shortest paths.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Network routing, transitive closure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kruskal's Algorithm\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph.\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Adds edges in increasing weight, avoiding cycles.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Network design, clustering analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prim's Algorithm\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph.\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Grows the spanning tree from a starting vertex by adding the cheapest edge from the tree to the graph.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Network design, infrastructure planning.\n"
