    "# Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linked List Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list is a fundamental data structure that consists of a series of elements, each contained in a \"node.\" The nodes are not stored in contiguous memory locations; instead, each node points to the next node in the sequence via a reference or a pointer. There are various types of linked lists, such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Singly Linked List**: Each node contains some data and a pointer to the next node in the list, with the last node pointing to `null`, indicating the end of the list.\n",
    "- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node, allowing traversal in both directions.\n",
    "- **Circular Linked List**: Similar to singly or doubly linked lists, but the last node points back to the first node, forming a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Algorithms on Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Traversal**: Sequentially accessing each node in the list. This is the basis for many linked list operations, requiring $O(n)$ time for a list with $n$ nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Insertion**:\n",
    "    - At the beginning: Insert a new node as the first node of the list.\n",
    "    - At the end: Append a new node after the current last node.\n",
    "    - After a given node: Insert a new node after a specified node.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Deletion**:\n",
    "    - Delete the first node.\n",
    "    - Delete the last node.\n",
    "    - Delete a node after a given node or with a specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Searching**: Find a node with a given value, typically requiring $O(n)$ time in the worst case.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reversal**: Reverse the links between the nodes, making the last node the first of the list and vice versa. This can be done iteratively or recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Detecting a Loop**: Algorithms such as Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm (also known as the tortoise and the hare algorithm) are used to detect loops within a linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Finding the Middle Element**: This can be done using the two-pointer technique, where one pointer advances twice as fast as the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Merging Two Sorted Lists**: Combining two sorted linked lists into a single sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Size**: Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow and shrink at runtime.\n",
    "- **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**: Adding or removing nodes requires only a change in pointers, which can be more efficient than arrays, especially when dealing with large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Direct Access**: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not provide direct access to the nodes by their position, making certain operations slower (e.g., accessing an element at a particular position).\n",
    "- **Memory Usage**: Each node in a linked list requires extra memory for storing the address of the next (and possibly previous) elements in addition to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked lists are a versatile and fundamental data structure, useful in scenarios where efficient insertion and deletion operations are prioritized, and memory allocation is not contiguous.\n",
